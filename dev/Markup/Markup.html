    <title>MarkSeq - a video markup program</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p><a href="../Application/MarkSeq.html">MarkSeq</a> is a very simple tool
    to help generate manual annotation of video sequences.  It is derived from
    VPlay, and so has the same video controls for play, single step etc.  The
    tool is very limited in what annotation it can create; however it is
    straightforward to modify its behaviour to suit your particular task.</p>

    <p>Usage:</p><ul> 
      <li>To get usage, type 
        <pre>MarkSeq -help</pre></li>

      <li>To use, first you need to create a file of the set of possible
      annotation strings, one to a line.  If you don't specify this file
      (option <code>-cf</code>), it will give you a list that was used for the
      Vampire tennis annotation project.</li>

      <li>To generate a markup:<ol>

          <li>Pause the video on the desired frame.</li>
          <li>Select one of the set of markup classes from the boxes on the right-hand side of the GUI.</li> 
          <li>Click on the current frame.</li></ol>

        This will generate a line in the file containing the frame no., the position of the (most recent) mouse click and the index of the markup class.
      </li>

      <li>At the top of the screen there are three numbers:<ul>
          <li>The middle one is the current frame.</li>
          <li>The left-hand one is the frame no. of the nearest preceding annotation</li>
          <li>The right-hand one is the frame no. of the nearest succeding annotation</li>

</ul></li>

      <li>The markup is save to a file specified by the (compulsory)
      <code>-mf</code> option.  However, it is <i>only</i> saved when you
        press the "Save marks" button, <i>NOT</i> when you quit from the program.  If
      the markup file already exists, the new markup is merged with the
      existing markup, so you can spread the marking up over several
      sessions.</li>

    </ul>
