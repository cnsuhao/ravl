LICENSE
-------

The RAVL libraries are distributed under the GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC 
LICENSE (LGPL), however some of the tools built with the library have
been issued under the more restrictive GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, the
headers attached to each of the files in the project indicate which of 
these apply.

It should be noted that this library is still in development so interfaces 
may change in future releases. RAVL is split up into modules some of which
are more stable than others, following is summary of the current status.


INSTALLATION
------------

To use the Contrib code, before building the RAVL libraries unpack the contrib.tar
file in the same directory as your RAVL source tree.  A new 'Contrib' directory should
appear in the root of the source tree.  Then add "Contrib.r" to the
end of the 'NESTED=' line in Ravl/defs.mk.  You can then build RAVL as normal.
