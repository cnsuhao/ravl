    <h2>General</h2>

    <p>These classes provide a machine-independent interface to allow
    the creation and management of threads within an application.</p>

    <p>For thread-safe operation, the following are the responsibility
    of the programmer:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All "non-const" shared resources must be locked.</li>
      
      <li>Always lock shared resources in the same order.</li>
    
      <li>All variables of built-in type in shared memory must be
	declared <code>volatile</code>.</li>
    
      <li>For efficient threading, lock shared resources for the minimum
      possible time.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Locking</h2>

    <p>To prevent multiple accesses to a resouce, on an equitable basis, use
    the mutex classes.  <a
    href="../Class/RavlN.MutexC.html"><code>MutexC</code></a> provides the
    shared object for a particular lock.  It is the programmer's
    responsibility to ensure that this lock remains valid while it is
    being used.</p>
    <p>  To protect a particular section of code, use <a
    href="../Class/RavlN.MutexLockC.html"><code>MutexLockC</code></a>,
    constructed on the <code>MutexC</code> object.  The exclusion lasts from
    the creation of the <code>MutexLockC</code> object until the first of these events:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>it goes out of scope;</li>
      <li>the <a
    href="../Class/RavlN.MutexLockC.html#UnlockObvoidCb"><code>MutexLockC::Unlock()</code></a>
    method is called;</li>
      <li>an exception is thrown.</li>
    </ul>
   For example, if <code>MutexC lock</code> has been
    instantiated (e.g. as a class member object), the call to
      <code>AccessSomeResource</code> is protected:</p>
    <pre>
 {
   MutexLockC hold(lock);
   AccessSomeResource();
 }</pre>
    <p>and the lock is released when it goes out of scope at the closing brace "}".</p>

    <p>If a lock is required that distinguished between read and write access,
    use <a href="../Class/RavlN.RWLockC.html"><code>RWLockC</code></a> and <a
    href="../Class/RavlN.RWLockHoldC.html"><code>RWLockHoldC</code></a>
    instead of <code>MutexC</code> and <code>MutexLockC</code> respectively.
    In this case:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Only one write lock may be held at a time.</li>
      <li>If a write lock is held, no read locks may be held.</li>
      <li>If no write lock is held, any number of read locks may be held.</li>
      <li>If a write lock is requested, no new read locks will be granted, but the write lock will not be granted until all of the outstanding read locks have completed.</li>
    </ul>
