Installation from source tarball

Basic operation is to extract the source from the tar archive; move to the
extracted directory and issue the relevant build commands:

        tar -xvf RAVL-1.1.tar
        cd ravl
        ./configure
        make
        make install

All built binaries and objects will be created in a tree under where the
initial configure was run.  Once RAVL has been built, 'make install' will
install the RAVL library and the utility programs. By default, these will be
installed under the system /usr/local directory. You may need additional user
privileges to complete this stage. Please consult your system administrator 
if you do not administer your own machine.

The default directories where RAVL is installed may be changed by using the
configure script. This is facilitated by the --prefix command-line switch.
This switch, along with other advanced installation topics, is discussed in
the INSTALL.ADVANCED file. In addition, a full list of configure's available
command-line switches and significant environment variables may be seen by
issuing the command:

        ./configure --help
