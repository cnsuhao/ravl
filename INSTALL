Installation from source tarball

Basic operation is to extract the source from the tar archive; move to the
extracted directory and issue the relevant build commands:

        tar -xvf RAVL-1.1.1.tar
        cd ravl
        ./configure
        make
        make install

All built binaries and objects will be created in a tree under where the
initial configure was run.  Once RAVL has been built, 'make install' will
install the RAVL library and the utility programs.  By default, these will be
installed under the system '/usr/local' directory.  You may need additional
user privileges to complete this stage.

The default installation directory may be changed by using the --prefix option 
at the configure stage, e.g.:

        ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/Ravl


To get the full range of configure options (discussed in INSTALL.ADVANCED), 
type:

        ./configure --help

If installed in the default location, (/usr/local), your system should already
be configured to use the RAVL libraries and utilities. If not, or if you have
selected a non-standard installation location for RAVL, there are two paths
that need setting up:

1) The bin directory (/usr/local/bin by default) should appear in the $PATH
environment variable, e.g. for bash users who have installed with a --prefix
of ${HOME}/Ravl:

        export PATH=${PATH}:${HOME}/Ravl/bin

2) The lib directory needs to be made known to the loader, either by including
it in the loader's configuration file (usually /etc/ld.so.conf or
/etc/ld.conf) or by adding to $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, e.g.:

        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:${HOME}/Ravl/lib

If you wish to use your own build system, rather than the one included with RAVL
(QMake), your  compilier and linker will also need to know the location of the
RAVL header files and library.
