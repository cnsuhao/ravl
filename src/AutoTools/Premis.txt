Basic Premiss

+ Replace existing install script and manual editing of config.local.XXX.
	- Largely complete; configure creates single Config.Package file

+ Combine all platform and machine specific configuration into one place 
  (Config.Package), replacing existing config.XXX and config.local.XXX
	- Location of the utilities necessary for documentation production
	  is not currently undertaken by configure (see Current Limitations). 

+ Provide a single Ravl library
	- Initial version completed providing build of single shared and 
	  static libraries. Development required to fully integrate dynamic
	  loading/MUSTLINKS into this new packaging format (see Current
	  Limitations).

+ Install single library and utility programs in system directories (/usr/lib;
  /usr/bin; etc.)
	- Next phase of development. Requires both 'make install' code to copy
	  across Ravl (from build structure to the system directories) and
	  modification to Ravl to cope with the modified paths this will cause
	  (PROJECT_OUT is mostly hard-coded into the objects at compile time).

+ Provide binary distribution
	-Follows adaptation of Ravl for deployment in /usr/lib, etc.
