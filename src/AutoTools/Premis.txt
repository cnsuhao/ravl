Basic Premiss

+ Replace existing install script and manual editing of config.local.XXX.
	- Largely complete; configure creates single Config.Project file

+ Combine all platform and machine specific configuration into one place 
  (Config.Project), replacing existing config.XXX and config.local.XXX
	- Location of the utilities necessary for documentation production
	  is not currently undertaken by configure (see Current Limitations). 

+ Provide a single Ravl library
	- Initial version completed providing build of single shared and 
	  static libraries. Development required to fully integrate dynamic
	  loading/MUSTLINKS into this new packaging format (see Current
	  Limitations).

+ Install single library and utility programs in system directories (/usr/lib;
  /usr/bin; etc.)
	- 'make install' copies all built utilities, the single shared-library
	   plus the Ravl header files, scripts, configuration; data and aux
	   files to the installation taret directories (under /usr/local by
	   default). 

+ Provide binary distribution
	-Follows adaptation of Ravl for deployment in /usr/lib, etc.

+ Separate QMake from Ravl
	- Largly achieved with QMake becomming a fully seperate build tool with
	  the exception that the Validate and CxxDoc tools are still built from
	  within Ravl (as they rely heavily on the Ravl package to provide
	  needed service routines).
