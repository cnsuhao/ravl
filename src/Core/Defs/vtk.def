  # Include relevant kits to make up as much of original libraries as is
  # portable (cannot exactly replicate the original list as some of the
  # libraries are not available on all platforms/versions of VTK - E.G. no
  # libvtkNetCDF for VTK 5.8 on Ubuntu 12.04, no libVPIC for vtk 5.2 on 
  # Ubuntu 10.04)

  include vtkGenericFiltering.def
  # Including this implicitly includes:
  #    vtkGraphics.def
  #    vtkFiltering.def
  #    vtkCommon.def
  include vtkIO.def
  include vtkImaging.def
  include vtkRendering.def
  include vtkVolumeRendering.def
  # We would need to include vtkWidgets.def and vtkHybrid.def to replicate
  # what was originally made available by this .def file. However, both of
  # these  libraries introduce portability issues, with vtkWidgets bringing
  # in vtkParallel.def which was not in the original set of libraries and
  # vtkHybrid needing vtkNetCDF which is not available in later packages.
