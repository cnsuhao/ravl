  #   vtkIO itself actually sometimes depends on vtksqlite and vtkNetCDF
  #   depending on the exact VTK package in use (version/OS combination).
  #   We should therefore automatically include those here on systems where
  #   the libraries exist. However, to prevent having to process version
  #   information, we omit them here. This should not pose a problem as
  #   we are only ever dynamically linking to the VTK libraries.
