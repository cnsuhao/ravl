    <p>These functions allow control of where programs and libraries look for
    data resources. Examples of such resources include fonts, images,
    configuration files etc.</p>
    <p>The default for the root of the resource directory is the root of the installation (and is therefore likely to be a read-only location).  More precisely, it is the value of <code>$PROJECT_OUT</code> when the function was compiled.  In practice therefore the default could have one of two values, depending on whether you are using the functions from an existing library or a version you have explicitly compiled yourself.  In the former case it will have a value corresponding to the root of the library; in the latter case, <code>$PROJECT_OUT</code>, if set.  In either case, there is no trailing separator.  If for any reason <code>$PROJECT_OUT</code> was not set when the functions were compiled, its value will be an empty string.  Use <code>SetResourceRoot()</code> to change the resource root.</p>
