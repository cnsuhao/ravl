    <p>These functions allow control of where programs and libraries look for program resources. Examples
of such resources include fonts, images, configuration files etc.</p>
    <p>The default resource root directory is set when the Ravl library is built and takes the value of where
Ravl is to be installed. It is therefore likely to be a read-only location.  Use <code>SetResourceRoot()</code>
to change this.</p>
