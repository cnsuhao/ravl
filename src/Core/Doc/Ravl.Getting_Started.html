    <title>How to write a simple RAVL program.</title>
  </head>

  <body>

    <p>
      This page shows how to write and compile a simple RAVL program. It
      assumes you already have a fully <a href="Ravl.Installation.html">installed</a>
      copy of RAVL. To build our RAVL application, we will use the
      <a href="Ravl.QMake.html">QMake</a> utility. This will have been
      automatically installed and configured as part of the RAVL installation.</p>
    
    <p>
      First, we need to tell QMake where we would like it to build the RAVL
      application to. When using QMake, any code that is built will be placed
      in the <a href="Ravl.QMake.Build_Structure.html">directory structure</a>
      pointed to by the <def>PROJECT_OUT</def> environment variable. By default,
      this output directory will be <code>$HOME/build</code> (the '<code>build</code>'
      directory under your home directory). You may set PROJECT_OUT to any
      location you choose (provided you have sufficient write privledges to
      create the directory and write files there), QMake will even create the
      directory for you if it does not exist.</p>

    <p>
      Besides informing QMake of where you would like your programs created,
      in order to run your RAVL programs, you will need to tell the system where
      your programs will be. You must therefore add the <code>$PROJECT_OUT/bin</code>
      directory to your system's PATH environment variable.

    <p>
      Create a directory of your choice and in it create two files. The first
      is <code>myprog.cc</code> with the following code. This just does some
      basic command line parsing, and loads an image. </p>

<pre>// myprog.cc

#include "Ravl/Option.hh"
#include "Ravl/IO.hh"
#include "Ravl/Image/Image.hh"
#include "Ravl/Image/ImgIO.hh"
#include "Ravl/Array2dIter.hh"

using namespace RavlImageN;
using namespace RavlN;

int main(int nargs,char **argv) {
  OptionC opt(nargs,argv);
  StringC infile  = opt.String("i","infile.pgm", "Input filename");
  StringC outfile = opt.String("o","outfile.pgm","Output filename");
  opt.Check();
  
  ImageC&lt;ByteT&gt; img;
  if(!Load(infile,img)) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "Failed to load file " &lt;&lt; infile &lt;&lt; "\n";
    return 1;
  }  	
  cout &lt;&lt; img.Frame() &lt;&lt; endl;  // see how big it is

  //.... Process img here ....
  for (Array2dIterC&lt;ByteT&gt; i(img); i; i++) {
    *i = 255 - *i;
  }
  
  if(!Save(outfile,img)) {
    cerr &lt;&lt; "Failed to save file " &lt;&lt; outfile &lt;&lt; "\n";
    return 1;
  }  	

  cout &lt;&lt; "Program finished\n";
  
  return 0;
}
</pre>

    <p>
      Next you'll have to tell QMake that you want to build an executable.  To
      do this, you need to create a file called <code>defs.mk</code> to
      tell it about files in the current directory.  More information on
      <code>defs.mk</code> files can be found in the <a
      href="Ravl.QMake.html#defs.mk">QMake documentation</a>.  For this example all you need to
      put in <code>defs.mk</code> is a single line: </p>

<pre>  MAINS=myprog.cc
</pre>

    <p>
      In the same directory, type <b>qm</b> and the make system will build an
      executable, storing it somewhere in <code>$PROJECT_OUT</code>.  When you
      run <b>qm</b> you'll get some messages similar to the following:</p>

<pre>% qm
--- Making dir /buf/ees1cg/share/RAVL/Admin/linux/depend/local/local/None 
--- Making dir /buf/ees1cg/qm//buf/ees1cg//linux/local/None/check/objs 
--- Compile check myprog.cc
--- Binary dependency myprog
--- Making dir /buf/ees1cg/lib/RAVL/linux/bin 
--- Making dir /buf/ees1cg/bin 
--- Creating redirect for myprog.
--- Linking check myprog ( /buf/ees1cg/lib/RAVL/linux/bin/myprog ) 
</pre>

    <p>In this example, <code>$PROJECT_OUT</code> was set to
      <code>/buf/ees1cg</code></p>

    <p>
      You can then run the program.  For example, to get the program to list
      its options you use the <code>-help</code> switch: </p>

<pre>% myprog -help
Usage: myprog [options] 
   -i (infile.pgm) [infile.pgm] Input filename 
   -o (outfile.pgm) [outfile.pgm] Output filename 
   -help (true) [false] Print usage information. 
</pre>

    <p>
      Congratulations, you've compiled and run your first Ravl program!</p>

    <p>
      Note: This example should be able to read in images in any of the pnm
      formats.  If you want to use this example to read in images in other
      formats, depending on the image format you may need to link in extra <a
      href="Ravl.API.Images.IO.html">image I/O libraries</a>.  If you want to
      display the result straight to the screen, you need to include the <a
      href="Ravl.API.Graphics.Data_Display.html">RavlDPDisplay</a> library, and
      specify "@X" as the output file.</p>
