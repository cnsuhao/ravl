This is very much a Work-In-Progress attempt to write a Python wrapper 
interface to the more commonly used (at least by me :-) parts of RAVL.

Basic instructions......

1. Build RAVL as optsharedne (os osne).  This will make a _RavlSwigPython2.so library in your PROJECT_OUT.
2. ln -s ${PROJECT_OUT}/lib/RAVL/linux64/opt/shared/_RavlSwigPython2.so  ${PROJECT_OUT}/lib/RAVL/linux64/opt/shared/_Ravl.so
3. PYTHONPATH=${PROJECT_OUT}/lib/RAVL/linux64/opt/shared:${PROJECT_OUT}/share/Python

Then you should be able to open a python interpreter, import Ravl and away you go....for example

import Ravl

v = Ravl.VectorC(10)
v.Fill(2.34)
print v

v2 = v * v
print v2
