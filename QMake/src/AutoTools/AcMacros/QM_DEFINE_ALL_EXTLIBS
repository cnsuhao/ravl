          dnl 
          dnl Now define those libraries needing manual compilation checks:
          dnl
          dnl Parameters are:
          dnl
          dnl  1 QMake name for library. The name used for RESOURCES and also
          dnl    for LIB_CFLAGS, LIB_LIBS, etc. used in Config.XX and the .def
          dnl    files.
          dnl  2 Fragment of code to verify that the library can be successfully
          dnl    linked to. Usually this is just a single call to a function
          dnl    declared by the external library. However, some libraries need
          dnl    a little more set up - such as any library where we need to
          dnl    test for a C++ class; or the Math library where some compilers 
          dnl    perform extra prototype checking on those functions.
          dnl  3 Space separated list of dependancies of the library. Specify
          dnl    the QMake name of the library - e.g. for dependancies on Zlib
          dnl    specify Zlib not -lz or z. 
          dnl    *** N.B. ***
          dnl         Dependancies on libraries reliant on pkg-config for their
          dnl         location are not supported. I.E. if library A depends on
          dnl         library B, library B must be specified here as a manual
          dnl         check if library A is also specified as a manual check.
          dnl         JFi:ToDo:Fix this limitation
          dnl  4 Link line entry for the library (in -lXXXX form) needed to
          dnl    compile against the library package <Lib>. For library
          dnl    packages that vary the names of the libraries required, this
          dnl    may be a set of alternative lists seperated by a pipe symbol.
          dnl    For example, the Socket library package uses the setting
          dnl    " | -lsocket | -lsocket -lnsl " as the socket() function may
          dnl    be available in the default libraries (no additional library 
          dnl    is required - hence the leading " | " setting, i.e. a null
          dnl    list); in the socket library itself; or in a socket library
          dnl    that also depends on libnsl.
          dnl  5 Name(s) of header files needed to use the library (only really
          dnl    need to provide one for a specimin test unless it is know that
          dnl    sub-sets of the header files are regularly seen in the wild).
          dnl    If specifying multiple headers, provide a space seperated list.
          dnl  6 Language in which the test code is written. This is usually the
          dnl    same language as the API for the external library. Currently
          dnl    only C and C++ are supported languages for this setting.

          dnl# Define BLAS support. This is a bit of a bodge as we should be
          dnl# testing for more Fortran functionality/configurataion here than
          dnl# we currently do. The problem with performing that testing is that
          dnl# the required autotools macros would mandate a Fortran compiler be
          dnl# present even when LAPACK support is omitted. 
          dnl# An example of the type of extra testing we should be performing
          dnl# comes from the fact that, dependant on the toolset in use,
          dnl# Fortran functions may be upper or lowercase; with or without a
          dnl# trailing underscore. By rights, we should use AC_F77_FUNC(sgemm)
          dnl# to return the correct name of that BLAS function and test for
          dnl# that rather than the hard coded lowercase_ form that we test for
          dnl# here. Other Fortran related checking we should be doing here
          dnl# includes determining any FLIBS setting that may be required
          dnl# (by calling AC_F77_LIBRARY_LDFLAGS) and using the
          dnl# AC_F77_DUMMY_MAIN macro. In addition to all this, we are only
          dnl# looking for -lblas. In fact, this is one of many libraries that
          dnl# may provide blas functionality (some boxes may even provide
          dnl# direct support that needs no other library). These libraries may
          dnl# be added at a later date on an as-needed basis. In the meantime,
          dnl# using the --with-blas-library switch will provide support.
