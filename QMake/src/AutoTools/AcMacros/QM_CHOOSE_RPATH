dnl QM_CHOOSE_RPATH
dnl
dnl Macro to allow user selection over the inclusion of paths to linked
dnl libraries when creating a binary or other library. Creates the cmd-line
dnl switch --with-rpath which is a simple Yes/No switch (usual abbreviation
dnl andcase rules apply) that enables or disables this functionality. The
dnl default is to enable the rpath functionality.
dnl
dnl No macro parameters
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl       with_rpath                 Value of similarly named cmd-line switch
dnl                                  Selects whether or not library paths
dnl                                  are automatically added to the runtime
dnl                                  searchlist of any produced binary. This
dnl                                  is a simple switch that takes a Y or N
dnl                                  as its value.
dnl       USR_with_rpath             Used to indicate if the user explicitly
dnl                                  caused with_rpath to be set, or if it
dnl                                  was subsiquently defaulted (variable
dnl                                  will only be set if the user specified
dnl                                  the with_rpath setting).
