dnl QM_FINISH_DEFINE
dnl
dnl Macro to finish the definition of an external resource. This will add the
dnl name of the resource to the list of known RESOURCES and record whether or
dnl not the user has explicitly configured the resource.
dnl
dnl Macro parameters are:
dnl       p1: QMake name for the resource. This is used for naming the
dnl           command-line switch (resource of "Name" implies switches
dnl           --with-Name, --with-Name-pkgconf, etc.); all internal (to
dnl           the configure program) variables and is the name to be
dnl           referenced in QMake's defs.mk files.
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   All variables listed with a <lib> in their name are created with the
dnl   <lib> being replaced by the QMake name of the package (the name passed
dnl   into this macro as the first parameter). For example,the OpenCV package
dnl   will have variables named use_OpenCV; with_OpenCV; etc.
dnl
dnl       ConfiguredLibs             Holds a space separated list of all of
dnl                                  the external RESOURCES that have been
dnl                                  explicitly configured by the user. This
dnl                                  macro appends the resource name to the
dnl                                  variable if the user supplied a command
dnl                                  line option for the library.
dnl       KnownLibs                  List of RESOURCES known to configure.
dnl                                  Appended with the resource name by this
dnl                                  macro.
dnl       <lib>_CFLAGS               Substitution variable (variable that is
dnl                                  output to the configuration file for both
dnl                                  QMake and client project (i.e. to the
dnl                                  Config.QMake and Config.Project files).
dnl                                  This variable receives the CFLAGS needed
dnl                                  when compiling with the external library.
dnl                                  This macro does not set this variable,
dnl                                  it merely declares it for substitution
dnl                                  out to the configuration files.
dnl       <lib>_CCFLAGS              C++ version of the above, <lib>_CFLAGS,
dnl                                  substitution variable. This macros does
dnl                                  not actually set this variable, merely
dnl                                  declares the variable for substitution
dnl                                  out to the configuration file.
dnl       <lib>_LIBS                 Substitution variable that receives the
dnl                                  link line settings needed to link with
dnl                                  the <lib> package. This info is supplied
dnl                                  as on the link line itself  i.e. library
dnl                                  names are specified in -lX form and the
dnl                                  setting may include -Lpath entries. This
dnl                                  macro does not set this variable, merely
dnl                                  declares it for substitution out to the
dnl                                  configuration files.
dnl       use_<lib>                  Flag specifying required usage of the
dnl                                  resource. Primed by the use of any of
dnl                                  the configure command-line switches,
dnl                                  this variable will currently be null
dnl                                  unless the user has explicitly
dnl                                  configured the resource. If the user
dnl                                  has not configured the resource, this
dnl                                  macro will default the variable to
dnl                                  check.
dnl       UnconfiguredLibs           Holds a space separated list of all the
dnl                                  external RESOURCES that have not been
dnl                                  explicitly configured by the user. This
dnl                                  macro appends the resource name to the
dnl                                  variable if the user has supplied no
dnl                                  command-line option for the library.
