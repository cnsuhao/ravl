dnl QM_DEFINE_VIRTUAL_EXTLIB
dnl
dnl Macro to define a virtual external library. A virtual library is one that
dnl is really a set of external libraries that are brought in as one, single
dnl library package. An example of a virtual library may be OpenGL that may
dnl be declared as the superset of the libGL and libGLU packages.
dnl
dnl Macro parameters are:
dnl       p1: QMake name for virtual library. This is used for naming the
dnl           cmd-line switch (LIB => --with-LIB, --with-LIB-pkgconf). It
dnl           should be the name any package expects the RESOURCES string to
dnl           take to enable the library's functionality. It will also be the
dnl           name used for the LIB_CFLAGS and LIB_LIBS used in the relevant
dnl           .def file and Config.Project.
dnl       p2: Prerequisites of the virtual library i.e. the other libraries
dnl           that make up this virtual package.
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   All variables listed with a <lib> in their name are created with the
dnl   <lib> being replaced by the QMake name of the package (the name passed
dnl   into this macro as the first parameter). For example,the OpenCV package
dnl   will have variables named use_OpenCV; with_OpenCV; etc.
dnl
dnl       fallback_file              This variable holds any file component
dnl                                  supplied via the --with-<lib> switch for
dnl                                  possible use if required to provide name
dnl                                  details for one of the other command-line
dnl                                  options. At present, this functionality
dnl                                  is not supported for virtual packages;
dnl                                  any such setting will be ignored and a
dnl                                  warning message will be issued.
dnl       fallback_path              This variable holds any directory path
dnl                                  component supplied via the --with-<lib>
dnl                                  switch for possible use if required to
dnl                                  provide name details for one of the
dnl                                  other command-line options. At present,
dnl                                  this functionality is not supported for
dnl                                  virtual packages; any such setting will
dnl                                  be ignored and a warning message will
dnl                                  be issued.
