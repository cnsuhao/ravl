dnl QM_DEFINE_EXTLIB_BESPOKE
dnl
dnl Macro to define an external library that requires bespoke code to check
dnl for its availability.
dnl
dnl This macro causes the declaration of the --with-<lib>-pkgconfig and the
dnl --with-<lib> command-line switches. For a bespoke-check library package,
dnl the --with-<lib>-pkgconf switch allows the user to over-ride the bespoke
dnl check and employ a pkg-config file (either one supplied with the package
dnl or by writing their own pkg-config metafile if one is unavailable for
dnl the package. The --with-<lib> switch allows the user to disable or
dnl specifically request the package.
dnl
dnl This macro is intended for those bespoke packages that are tested for by
dnl pkg-config or are virtual packages. For those bespoke packages that will
dnl require a compilation test, please use the QM_DEFINE_EXTLIB_BESPOKE_CC
dnl version of this macro as this will additionally declate the appropriate
dnl --with-<lib>-library and --with-<lib>-include switches as well as allowing
dnl the definition of the library to preform the link against.
dnl
dnl Macro parameters are:
dnl       p1: QMake name for the library. This is used for naming the
dnl           cmd-line switch (LIB => --with-LIB, --with-LIB-pkgconf). It
dnl           should be the name any package expects the RESOURCES string to
dnl           take to enable the library's functionality. It will also be the
dnl           name used for the LIB_CFLAGS and LIB_LIBS used in the relevant
dnl           .def file and Config.Project.
dnl       p2: Prerequisites (if any) that the bespoke-check library depends
dnl           upon.
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   All variables listed with a <lib> in their name are created with the
dnl   <lib> being replaced by the QMake name of the package (the name passed
dnl   into this macro as the first parameter). For example,the OpenCV package
dnl   will have variables named use_OpenCV; with_OpenCV; etc.
dnl
dnl       with_<lib>_prq             Space separated list of pre-requisites
dnl                                  of the library.
