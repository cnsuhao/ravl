dnl QM_COMPILE_CK_FOR_LIB
dnl
dnl Macro to check if the given library package exits on the system. This
dnl will check for both the library itself and its header files. This macro
dnl is intended for checking those libraries that do not come with a 
dnl pkg-configure file.
dnl
dnl Macro parameters are:
dnl       p1: QMake name for library
dnl       p2: Library to test for (-lxx)
dnl       p3: Code to link against the library to test for it
dnl       p4: Path to the library if not on system defaults
dnl       p5: List of header files to test for
dnl       p6: Path to the library's headers if not in system defaults
dnl       p7: Action to take if the library package is present and usable
dnl       p8: Action to take if the library package is missing or unusable
dnl       p9: Other libraries that are needed for the link test; then
dnl           prerequisites of the library being tested
dnl
dnl

dnl                                  construct will get expanded to ${param}x
dnl                                  rather than perform the substitution for

dnl                                  line for a particular prerequisite.
dnl       new_prereqlibpath          Interim variable used when determining

dnl       preamble                   Interim variable used to include all of
dnl                                  the external library header files in the
dnl                                  source used for the link test

dnl                                  libraries that must be used during the
dnl                                  test link, so that the prerequsites are
dnl                                  satisfied.
dnl       prereqlib                  Interim iterator for processing the
dnl                                  prerequisite library packages.
dnl       stripspaces                Interim variable used to overcome a 
dnl                                  limitation of the m4 substitution 
dnl                                  process that sees trailing spaces

dnl                                  messages (when DBG is set). The current

dnl                                  an indent of 5 spaces per level of 
dnl                                  nesting in the code i.e. set the var to
dnl                                  "     " for the first for loop, set it
dnl                                  to "          " for the second, etc.
