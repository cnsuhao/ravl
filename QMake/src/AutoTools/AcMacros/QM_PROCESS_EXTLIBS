dnl QM_PROCESS_EXTLIBS
dnl
dnl Macro to check if the declared external library packages exist on the
dnl system. This will check for libraries specified via pkg-configure
dnl directly and for libraries requiring a compilation check by calling the
dnl QM_COMPILE_CK_FOR_LIB macro. 
dnl
dnl All libraries to be checked for must have previously been declared via
dnl either the QM_DEFINE_EXTLIB_PC (for libraries that support pkg-config);
dnl QM_DEFINE_EXTIB_CC (libraries that will require a compilation test) or
dnl via QM_EFINE_VIRTUAL_EXTLIB (for virtual libraries that are really just
dnl a super-set of other, already declared, external libraries).
dnl
dnl This macro also checks for consistency over the header layout employed by
dnl any FFMPEG libraries and appends the appropriate CFLAG (-DFFMPEG_OLD_HDR) 
dnl if the old layout of the header files is in use.
dnl
dnl No macro parameters
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   All variables listed with a <lib> in their name exist for each library
dnl   that has been declared (via a QM_DEFINE_EXTLIB_[CP]C) with the <lib>
dnl   being replaced by the RESOURCE name of the package. For example,
dnl   the OpenCV package will have variables named with_OpenCV_fn; 
dnl   with_OpenCV_hdr; use_OpenCV; etc. Similarly, libGTK2 has variables
dnl   use_libGTK2; with_GTK2_pkgconf; etc.
dnl
dnl       CDC_HDR                } { Receives the type of header file layout
dnl       FMT_HDR                } { in use for the particular sub-package of
dnl       SWS_HDR                } { FFMPEG. Will be set to old; new; either
dnl       UTIL_HDR               } { or notfound dependant on the available
dnl                                { versions of the sub-packages. If all 4
dnl                                { packages are available, a consistent
dnl                                { grouping will be preferred (either all
dnl                                { old or all new), with the new layout
dnl                                { being preferred if either is available
dnl                                { for all 4.
dnl       FFMPEG_HDR_FMT             Receives the consistent layout, if it
dnl                                  exists, of the individual FFMPEG header
dnl                                  files. If a set of 4 consistent hdr sets
dnl                                  is not present, this variable will be
dnl                                  set to broken and the libffmpeg virtual

dnl       DBG                        Variable that holds the current trace
dnl                                  level as requested by the user. Requires
dnl                                  the inclusion of the debug function
dnl                                  "trace" in any code calling this macro.
dnl                                  A suitable trace function is defined in
dnl                                  the QMake AcMacros/QM_Debug_fn file.
dnl       LibsToProcess              List of the external libs that need

dnl                                  project; this will be only the packages
dnl                                  that the user has configured on the

dnl       TRACE_INDENT               Variable used for indenting trace debug
dnl                                  messages (when DBG is set). The current
dnl                                  convention in this script is to employ
dnl                                  an indent of 5 spaces per level of 
dnl                                  nesting in the code i.e. set the var to

dnl                                  to "          " for the second, etc.

dnl       with_<lib>_hdr             List of header files to test the

dnl       with_<lib>_libpath         Path to the location of the library

dnl       with_<lib>_pkgconf         Value of similarly named cmd-line switch
dnl                                  Specifies what name pkg-config will know
