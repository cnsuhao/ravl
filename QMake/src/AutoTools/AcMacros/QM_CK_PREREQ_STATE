dnl QM_CK_PREREQ_STATE
dnl
dnl Macro to check if we currently know if the pre-requisites of the specified
dnl external library package exist on the system. This macro is for libraries
dnl specified as requiring a bespoke or compilation check rather than being
dnl specified via pkg-config.
dnl
dnl Any package that is quantified as being either present or absent will be
dnl removed from the global variable LeftToDo At the same time, a quantified
dnl package will be added to the list held by the RecentlyProcessed variable.
dnl
dnl Macro parameters are:
dnl       p1: QMake name for the external package
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   All variables listed with a <lib> in their name exist for each library
dnl   that has been declared (via a QM_DEFINE_EXTLIB_[CP]C) with the <lib>
dnl   being replaced by the resource name of the package. For example,
dnl   the OpenCV package will have variables named with_OpenCV_prq;
dnl   use_OpenCV; etc. Similarly, libGTK2 has variables use_libGTK2;
dnl   with_libGTK2_prq; etc.
dnl
dnl       LeftToDo                   List of the external RESOURCES that are
dnl                                  left to be processed. This macro deletes
dnl                                  the resource from this list if it can
dnl                                  determine whether or not the resource is
dnl                                  available for use.
dnl       RecentlyProcessed          Keeps track of the recently located
dnl                                  RESOURCES. This macro adds the resource
dnl                                  to this list if it can determine whether
dnl                                  or not the resource is available for use.
dnl       process_now                Initialised by this macro to signal if the
dnl                                  library package is ready for its
dnl                                  availability check or if we should delay
dnl                                  the check (usually to allow us to find a
dnl                                  pre-requisite first).
dnl       SED                        Holds the name of the executable to carry
dnl                                  out stream editing. This will already
dnl                                  have been primed by a prior call to the
dnl                                  macro QM_LOCATE_KEY_TOOLS.
dnl       TRACE_INDENT               Variable used for indenting trace debug
dnl                                  messages (when DBG is set). The current
dnl                                  convention in this script is to employ
dnl                                  an indent of 5 spaces per level of
dnl                                  nesting in the code i.e. set the var to
dnl                                  "     " for the first for loop, set it
dnl                                  to "          " for the second, etc.
dnl       with_<lib>_prq             Space separated list of pre-requisites
dnl                                  of the external library.
dnl       use_<lib>                  Flag specifying usage of the resource. 
dnl                                  Initially primed from the command line
dnl                                  settings, this will be updated to
dnl                                  reflect the availability of the resource.
