# Trace debug function
#
# Set DBG=<level> in the environment for extra output messages. Arguments to
# the function are the 'level' of the trace message, and the message itself
# (which may be provided over multiple arguments). Current values of level
# are: 
#	1 Assertions, 
#	2 Progress tracing, 
#	3 Moderate data reporting
#       :
#       6 High data reporting
#
# If an indentation is required (say, for iterated code), set TRACE_INDENT to
# the indentation as you want if to appear on the screen (i.e. a number of
# spaces, or -->, etc.). Current scheme is to use five spaces per level of 
# indent.
