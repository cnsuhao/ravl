dnl QM_SET_MAKE_MAKEFLAGS
dnl
dnl Macro to declare the flags required to configure make for operation with
dnl QMake.
dnl
dnl No macro parameters.
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl       GNU_MAKE                   Flag, originally set by QM_LOCATE_MAKE
dnl                                  indicating if a GNU version of make is
dnl                                  in use. Set to yes for GNU make.
dnl       MAKE_SPECIFIC_MAKEFLAGS    Receives the MAKEFLAGS that relate to
dnl                                  the specific make utility in use. The
dnl                                  settings enable the make functionality
dnl                                  required for the operation of QMake.
dnl       MAKEFLAGS                  Not actually modified or interrogated
dnl                                  by this macro; merely declared for 
dnl                                  output substitution into the configure
dnl                                  settings file. Holds any user-supplied
dnl                                  MAKEFLAGS.

          dnl
          dnl Currently we only know of differing flags if the GNU version
          dnl of make is in use. If this situation changes, the following
          dnl standard caveat must be maintained in this code, especially
          dnl if we ever have to test the platform or OS in use:
          dnl
          dnl DO NOT PUT PLATFORM SPECIFICS HERE. If your platform has a
          dnl non-standard make that takes completely different flags then
          dnl that is ok to list here (as it pertains to the tool itself,
          dnl not the platform). If your platform uses the GNU make but, for
          dnl example requires an added 's' flag, that setting should be put
          dnl in the platform specific code at the end of this script, not
          dnl here.
          dnl

          else
             # Potential to add further options here for particular versions of make
             # However, at the moment we just have a standard option for all
             MAKE_SPECIFIC_MAKEFLAGS=" -r "
