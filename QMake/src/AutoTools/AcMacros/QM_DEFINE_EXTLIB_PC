dnl QM_DEFINE_EXTLIB_PC
dnl
dnl Macro to define all helper libs that rely on pkg-config to see if they
dnl exist. This macro will declare the --with-<lib> command-line switch and
dnl create the simple --help text. The command-line switch will support a
dnl Yes/No (upper, lower and sentence case accepted; plus Y,N) to explicitly 
dnl en/dis-able use of the library; or 'check' (C, Ck, or Check etc.) to ask
dnl to utilise the library if it is available (the default option). The macro
dnl will go on to declare the --with-<lib>-pkgconf switch that explicitly
dnl sets the pkg-config control file to use to check for the helper library.
dnl This switch should be set to the full path of the control file.
dnl
dnl Macro parameters are:
dnl       p1: QMake name for library. This is used for naming the cmd-line
dnl           switch (LIB => --with-LIB, --with-LIB-pkgconf). It should be
dnl           the name QMake expects the RESOURCES string to take to enable
dnl           the library's functionality. It will also be the name used
dnl           for the LIB_CFLAGS and LIB_LIBS used in the relevant .def
dnl           file and Config.Project. 
dnl       p2: Default name by which pkg-config knows the library.
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   All variables listed with a <lib> in their name are created with the
dnl   <lib> being replaced by the QMake name of the package (the name passed
dnl   into this macro as the first parameter). For example,the OpenCV package 
dnl   will have variables named with_OpenCV; with_OpenCV; etc.
dnl
dnl       with_<Lib>                 Value of similarly named cmd-line switch
dnl                                  Enables (actually requires) the use of
dnl                                  the particular library. Can also be used
dnl                                  to specify the location of the library
dnl                                  and header files when the specific
dnl                                  command-line switches are not used
dnl                                  (ideal if both file types reside in the
dnl                                  same directory).
dnl       with_<lib>_check           Flag specifying the type of test needed
dnl                                  to check for the existance of the

dnl                                                   the library is available.
dnl                                    pkgconfig    - test for the external
dnl                                                   library using pkg-config.
dnl                                    virtual      - external library is a
dnl                                                   virtual set of libraries
dnl                                                   that is implicitly
