dnl QM_DEFINE_EXTLIB_PC
dnl
dnl Macro to define all helper libs that rely on pkg-config to see if they
dnl exist.
dnl
dnl Macro parameters are:
dnl       p1: QMake name for library. This is used for naming the cmd-line
dnl           switch (LIB => --with-LIB, --with-LIB-pkgconf). It should be
dnl           the name QMake expects the RESOURCES string to take to enable
dnl           the library's functionality. It will also be the name used
dnl           for the LIB_CFLAGS and LIB_LIBS used in the relevant .def
dnl           file and Config.Project.
dnl       p2: Default name by which pkg-config knows the library.
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   All variables listed with a <lib> in their name are created with the
dnl   <lib> being replaced by the QMake name of the package (the name passed
dnl   into this macro as the first parameter). For example,the OpenCV package
dnl   will have variables named use_OpenCV; with_OpenCV; etc.
dnl
dnl       fallback_file              This variable holds any file component
dnl                                  supplied via the --with-<lib> switch for
dnl                                  possible use if required to provide name
dnl                                  details for one of the other command-line
dnl                                  options. At present, this functionality
dnl                                  is not supported for pkg-config packages;
dnl                                  any such setting will be ignored and a
dnl                                  warning message will be issued.
dnl       fallback_path              This variable holds any directory path
dnl                                  component supplied via the --with-<lib>
dnl                                  switch for possible use if required to
dnl                                  provide name details for one of the
dnl                                  other command-line options. At present,
dnl                                  this functionality is not supported for
dnl                                  pkg-config packages; any such setting
dnl                                  will be ignored and a warning message
dnl                                  will be issued.
