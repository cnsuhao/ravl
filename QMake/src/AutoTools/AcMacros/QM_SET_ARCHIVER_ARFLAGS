AC_DEFUN([QM_SET_ARCHIVER_ARFLAGS],
         [trace 2 Set archiver specific ARFLAGS
          
          
          dnl If redesigning this macro, bear in mind that no user specified
          dnl ARFLAGS are allowed owing to the nature of how ar works, such
          dnl flags would most likely break the build.
          dnl
          dnl Currently we do not know of any differing flags dependant on
          dnl the particular implementation of the tool in use. If this
          dnl situation changes, the following standard caveat must be
          dnl maintained in this code, especially if we ever have to test
          dnl the platform or OS in use:
          dnl
          dnl DO NOT PUT PLATFORM SPECIFICS HERE. If your platform has a
          dnl non-standard ar that takes completely different flags then
          dnl that is ok to list here (as it pertains to the tool itself,
          dnl not the platform). If your platform uses the GNU version of ar
          dnl but, for example requires an added 's' flag, that setting
          dnl should be put in the platform specific code at the end of this
          dnl script, not here.
