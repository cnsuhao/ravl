dnl QM_READ_USER_ENV
dnl
dnl Macro to record any user-defined settings for those UNIX tools that are
dnl configured by means of environment variables. Any user-provided paths
dnl for these tools will ultimately be used in preference to configure
dnl locating the executable itself. 
dnl
dnl For those tools that do not already have a help description associated
dnl with their controlling environment variable, this macro also declares the
dnl help text to be displayed on a configure --help.
dnl
dnl No Macro parameters
dnl
dnl Global variables used:
dnl
dnl   The <CMD> shown in the following list of variables represents that the
dnl   variable exists for each external program considered by this macro. For
dnl   instance, the support for the touch utility inspires both a TOUCH and
dnl   a USER_TOUCH global variable.
dnl
dnl       <CMD>                      Holds the path to the associated external 
dnl                                  utility. Will be initially primed with
dnl                                  any setting that the user has requested.
dnl                                  If no user preference is supplied this
dnl                                  variable will ultimately receive the path
dnl                                  of where the configure script finds the
dnl                                  utility. This variable is used whenever
dnl                                  the utility needs to be used by either the
dnl                                  configure script or QMake.
dnl       USER_<CMD>                 Receives any particular setting for <cmd>
dnl                                  that the user has explicitly requested.
dnl                                  This variable is used to both preserve the
dnl                                  user setting and flag that there was one
dnl                                  specified.
