# Instructions.
# -------------
#
# This pro-forma file may be used to create a .def file to allow the use of an
# external library in a QMake project. To use this file, simply replace all
# ocurrences of SKELETON_ with an appropriate identifier for your external
# library. You should then save the modified file as XX.def where XX is the
# identifier that you chose to use. Finally, add a EXTERNALLIBS=XX entry (once
# again, where XX is your chosen identifier) to the defs.mk file in the current
# directory.
#
# When you wish to use the external library from your code, simply add the XX
# identifier to the appropriate PROGLIBS, USESLIBS or TESTLIBS setting in the
# defs.mk file for the code that will use the external library.
#
# As can be seen from studying this file, the standard mechanism used here
# relies on the configuration variables XX_LIBS and XX_CFLAGS (for your
# identifier, XX) being defined. These should be set in your Config.Project
# file. They should be set to the options needed to compile with the external
# library that you are attmepting to use. If the external library supports the
# pkg-config utility, you may determine what the required setting for XX_LIBS
# is by issuing the command:
#
#        pkg-config --libs /path/to/external/libs/pkgconfig/file
#
# and determine the setting for XX_CFLAGS by issuing the command:
#
#       pkg-config --cflags /path/to/external/libs/pkgconfig/file
#
#
# If you wish, when you create your new .def file, you may remove this
# Instructions comment and all of the following illustrative comments. Please
# retain the file header.



# The following two lines provide a guard to stop the file being included multiple times
ifndef SKELETON_DEF

  SKELETON_DEF = 1


  # The EXELIB variable instructs QMake of the libraries that should be linked
  # in when building the current program. The following line prepends the
  # existing list of libraries with the libraries associated with your external
  # library. It relies on the actual values being defined in the Config.Project
  # file as the initial setting of the XXX_LIBS variable (where XX is the
  # identifier you choose to to identify the external library with). You should
  # ensure that the Config.Project file includes the XXX_LIBS=... setting that
  # is appropriate for your machine/external library configuration.
  EXELIB := $(SKELETON_LIBS) $(EXELIB)

  # The INCLUDES variable instructs QMake where to locate the header files
  # associated with the external library. It relies on the actual values being
  # defined in the XX_CFLAGS variable (where XX is the identifier you choose to
  # use to identify the external library). This variable must be defined in your
  # Config.Project file.
  INCLUDES += $(SKELETON_CFLAGS)
