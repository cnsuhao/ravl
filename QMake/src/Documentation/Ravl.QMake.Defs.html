<H3><A NAME="naming"></A>Project Naming</H3>
<p>QMake divides up applications into the concept of a PROJECT and optionally
several PACKAGEs. A PROJECT is the entire application suite that is being built
by QMake, while a PACKAGE is a distinct logical sub-set of the software suite
(be that a grouping defined by functionality, authorship or any other such
classification). The following defs.mk file entries allow the user to declare
the structure appropriate for their application. </p>

<UL>

<LI><DT><A NAME="PROJECT_NAME"></A><B>PROJECT_NAME</B></DT>
<DD> <p>  The name of the project to which the whole directory tree belongs.
This setting defines multiple aspects of the project, including the naming used
on any documentation that is produced and the subdirectory path where public
data or include files are installed. </p>
<p>For example, a defs.mk file containing the following:</p><code><pre>
    PROJECT_NAME = MyProject

    PACKAGE = Functionality

    HEADERS = HeaderFile.hh

    DATA = DataFile

    DATADIR = Data
</pre></code><p> means that all public header files will be copied into the
directory: </p><code><pre>
    $PROJECT_OUT/include/MyProject/Functionality
</pre></code><p> so the header file <code>HeaderFile.hh</code> would be used in
any C++ source code by using the statement: </p><code><pre>
    #include "MyProject/Functionality/HeaderFile.hh"
</pre></code><p> and the data file, <code>DataFile</code> would ultimately be
installed in: </p><code><pre>
    $datadir/MyProject/Functionality/Data
</pre></code>
</DD>
<LI><DT><A NAME="PACKAGE"></A><B>PACKAGE</B></DT>
<DD><p><b>Advanced users only.</b></p>
<p>  The name of the sub-package to which the directory belongs. In fact, it is
a part of the subdirectory path where public data or include files are copied.
For example, </p><code><pre>
    PROJECT_NAME = MyProject

    PACKAGE = Functionality

    HEADERS = HeaderFile.hh

    DATA = DataFile

    DATADIR = Data
</pre></code><p> means that all public header files will be copied into the
directory: </p><code><pre>
    $PROJECT_OUT/include/MyProject/Functionality
</pre></code><p> so the header file <code>HeaderFile.hh</code> would be used in
any C++ source code by using the statement: </p><code><pre>
    #include "MyProject/Functionality/HeaderFile.hh"
</pre></code><p> and the data file, <code>DataFile</code> would ultimately be
installed in: </p><code><pre>
    $datadir/MyProject/Functionality/Data
</pre></code>

<P><font size = +1><b>ATTENTION!!</b></font> Use of the PACKAGE concept should
be carefully planned. It should be used to group similar functionality together
to aid organisation of the installed header or data files. However, care should
be taken so as to avoid a situation where many different PACKAGEs are defined,
each declaring a directory that contains only a few files. Furthermore, once
implemented, the variable should not be changed arbitrarily because it will
break code that depends on the library.</P>
</DD>
</UL>
<p>Some existing software employs a depreciated form of the project/package
naming mechanism. This form uses solely the PACKAGE variable to organise the
source code by setting PACKAGE=Project/Package. We suggest that new code
implement the current form that uses the PROJECT_NAME variable alongside the
PACKAGE setting.</p>




<H3><A NAME="description"></A>Directory structure</H3>

<P> The QMake system is capable of building a tree of directories. The following
variable is used to specify the branches from the current directory. </P>
<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="NESTED"></A><B>NESTED</B></DT>
<DD><p>The QMake system is capable of building a tree of directories. NESTED
defines the list of subdirectories which are built before the current directory.
A suffix '.r' flag is used to indicate that the directory is ready to be built
otherwise it is ignored. For example: <code><pre> 
    NESTED = Vector.r Matrix List.r
</pre></code>means that the directory Vector is built first and List is built
second. Matrix is skipped.</p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="DESCRIPTION"></A><B>DESCRIPTION</B></DT> 
<DD><p>The DESCRIPTION variable defines a one line description of the directory
contents. This should give potential users an idea about the functionality that
this directory contributes to the project. E.g. for the CxxDoc directory: <code><pre>
    DESCRIPTION = The QMake C++ Documentation tool
</pre></code></p>
</DD>
</UL>



<H3><A NAME="source"></A>Source Files</H3>

<P> The compilation of libraries and executables are controlled by the following
variables: </P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="MAINS"></A><B>MAINS</B></DT>
<DD><p>Lists all source files that compile into executables. When QMake builds
your project, each file listed in MAINS is compiled based on the suffix of the
file name. The following <A NAME="Suffixes"></A>suffixes are supported:</p>
<UL>
<li> <b>.cc</b> or <b>.cxx</b> for programs written in C++. May be overridden
by using the <a href="#CXXEXT">CXXEXT</a> or <a href="#CXXAUXEXT">CXXAUXEXT</a> 
variables.
<li> <b>.c</b> for programs written in C. May be overridden by using the
<a href="#CEXT">CEXT</a> variable.
<li> <b>.f</b> or <b>.for</b> for programs written in Fortran.
<li> <b>.java</b> for programs written in Java.
</UL>

<p>For example, <code><PRE>
    MAINS = rgbTool.cc matcher.c
</PRE></code> will make two executables; rgbTool and matcher.  The first one
will see rgbTool.cc compiled using the C++ compiler, while the second,
matcher.c, is compiled by the C compiler.</p>

<p> Once the source files listed in MAINS have been compiled, QMake will proceed
to produce an executable for each file. The compiled object file will be linked
with any library specified by the <a href="#PLIB">PLIB</A>,
<a href="#USESLIBS">USESLIBS</A> and <a href="#PROGLIBS">PROGLIBS</A>
definitions and any object file indicated by the
<a href="#MUSTLINK">MUSTLINK</a> setting. The resultant executable will be named
as per the entry in MAINS (minus the suffix)</p>

<P> The names of the executables listed in all of the MAINS variables across the
whole project must be unique (including at the base name level, you cannot have
both a program.c and a program.for) </P>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="SCRIPTS"></A><B>SCRIPTS</B></DT>
<DD><p>Lists all the source files that provide the non-compiled executables of
your application, such as regular shell scripts (Bourne, C shell, etc.) or 
interpreted programs (Perl, Ruby, etc.). </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="SOURCES"></A><B>SOURCES</B></DT>
<DD><p>All source files which are not main programs.  If the variable
<a href="#PLIB">PLIB</A> is defined, they are added to the library so defined.
The <a href="#Suffixes">source file suffixes</a> play the same role as in the
variable <a href="#MAINS">MAINS</a>.</p>

<P> It is recommended that the names of files in all the SOURCES variables
across your project should be unique. This will avoid clashes of names during
any later restructuring of libraries.  As a minimum, the <b>names must be unique
within the library specified by the variable PLIB</b>.</P>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="MUSTLINK"></A><B>MUSTLINK</B></DT>
<DD> <p><b>Advanced users only.</b></p>
<p>This is a list of source files that MUST be linked when using a library. The
<a href="#Suffixes">suffixes</a> play the same role as in the variable
<a href="#MAINS">MAINS</a>.</p>

<P> The name of files specified in MUSTLINK, must be unique with respect
to all other files specified in MUSTLINK throughout the project.  This directive
can be used to force files to be included into executables, where dependencies
alone would not caused it to be linked.  This mechanism can be used where
constructors for global variables modify, or add to, global databases. </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="HEADERS"></A><B>HEADERS</B></DT>
<DD><p>Declares the list of public header files, i.e. those headers that may be
use by source files outside of the current directory. These files are
automatically exported by QMake to the directory
<code>include/$(PROJECT_NAME)/$(PACKAGE)</code>, to make them available to other
source files.  E.g. if you have a file <code>HeaderFile.hh</code> to export, the
content of the defs.mk file will be: </p><code><pre>
    PROJECT_NAME = MyProject

    PACKAGE = Functionality

    HEADERS = HeaderFile.hh
</pre></code><p> Thus to #include the header file, you need to put: </p>
<pre><code>    #include "MyProject/Functionality/HeaderFile.hh"
</code></pre> 

<p>if either <a href="#PROJECT_NAME">PROJECT_NAME</a> or
<a href="#PACKAGE">PACKAGE</a> is not set, that level will be omitted from the
header path. For example, if PACKAGE were not set in the previous example, the
header file would have been <code>"MyProject/HeaderFile.hh"</code>.</p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="LOCALHEADERS"></A><B>LOCALHEADERS</B></DT>
<DD><p>Header files which are used only for compilation in the current
directory. These header files are not exported. </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="CHXX"></A><B>CHXX</B></DT>
<DD><p> Extension expected for C++ header files. Defaults to '.hh'. </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="CXXEXT"></A><B>CXXEXT</B></DT>
<DD><p> Extension expected for C++ source files. Defaults to '.cc'. </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="CXXAUXEXT"></A><B>CXXAUXEXT</B></DT>
<DD><p> Auxiliary extension for C++ source files. Defaults to '.cxx'. </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="CEXT"></A><B>CEXT</B></DT>
<DD><p> Extension expected for C source files. Defaults to '.c'. </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="CHEXT"></A><B>CHEXT</B></DT>
<DD><p> Extension expected for C header files. Defaults to '.h'. </p>
</DD>
</UL>




<H3><A NAME="libs"></A>Libraries</H3>

These variables control the generation and linking of libraries.

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="PLIB"></A><B>PLIB</B></DT>
<DD><p>Use this to give your library a name (hence it must take only one
value):</p><code><pre>
    PLIB = mylib
</pre></code><p> It is the name of the library in which the modules specified by
the variable <a href="#SOURCES">SOURCES</a> are archived.  A unique name for
each directory is recommended.  On the other hand, if you want to use the same
PLIB library name for several directories, you need in addition to use the
<a href="#LIBDEPS">LIBDEPS</a> variable.</p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="USESLIBS"></A><B>USESLIBS</B></DT>
<DD><p>This is an unordered list of the libraries needed to build the new
library specified by <a href="#PLIB">PLIB</a>.  Use of this variable causes the
automatic creation of a ".def" file called (PLIB).def.  There are different ways
of creating this list:</p>
<ul>
<li>The easiest usage is simply to use the value <A NAME="Auto"></A>"Auto":
<code><pre>
    USESLIBS = Auto
</pre></code>
This should automatically generate the required list of libraries for both
USESLIBS and <a href="#PROGLIBS">PROGLIBS</a>, without you even noticing.

<li>The previous usage will not pick up any libraries that don't have a
corresponding header file anywhere, which happens occasionally.  Use the "QLibs"
tool (which is what makes the "Auto" method work) to print out the list of
libraries that the Auto method can find; manually add these to USESLIBS along
with those missing owing to the lack of a header.

<li>The traditional way was to create the list yourself, using the libraries
indicated in the class pages, e.g.: 
<code><PRE>
    USESLIBS = MyCore MyIOlib
</PRE></code>
You need only specify libraries you use explicitly; any others will be
automatically included.
</ul>

<P><font size = +1><b>ATTENTION!!</b></font> If this variable is set the .def
file is ALWAYS automatically generated. If <a href="#LIBDEPS">LIBDEPS</a> is set
as well then this is used as the name of the generated file. if you have a
library which depends on nothing else, but you wish to create a .def file, you
may set USESLIBS to the dummy library 'None'.  For example, </p><code><pre>
    USESLIBS = None
</pre></code>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="PROGLIBS"></A><B>PROGLIBS</B></DT>
<DD><p>The name of the libraries used to create executables specified in either
<a href="#MAINS">MAINS</a> or <a href="#EXAMPLES">EXAMPLES</a> that are not
already included with the <a href="#USESLIBS">USESLIBS</a> variable.  Typically
you would include things like IO code which is not needed for the
<a href="#PLIB">PLIB</a> library itself. For example the defs.mk file
of: </p><code><PRE>
    PLIB = MyDataProc

    USESLIBS = MyMathRoutines

    PROGLIBS = MyWindowIO

    MAINS = DeskTopDataProc.cc
</PRE></code><p> would use the three libraries; MyDataProc, MyMathRoutines and
MyWindowIO when linking the DeskTopDataProc program. Any other program that
uses the MyDataProc library, will automatically link in both that library and
MyMathRoutines but will not automatically need MyWindowIO (unless that program
uses the windowing code and explicitly lists MyWindowIO as one of its required
libraries). </p>

<p> You can use the
<a href="#Auto">automatic methods described under USESLIBS</a> for PROGLIBS as
well.</p>

<P> Normally all libraries specified in PROGLIBS are required to exist to create
the executables. This is not always ideal, as some libraries may relate to
functionality that is not always required, or is not present on all systems.
With this type of library, we may want to include them if they are available,
but ignore them if the are not present. This can be achieved by adding 
<code>.opt</code> to the end of the library names, indicating they are optional.
For example an optional library would be added as: </p><code><pre>
    PROGLIBS = MyOptionalLib.opt
</pre></code>     
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="TESTLIBS"></A><B>TESTLIBS</B></DT>
<DD><p>The name of the libraries used to create test executables (specified in
<a href="#TESTEXES">TESTEXES</a>) that are not already included with the
<a href="#USESLIBS">USESLIBS</a> variable. Typically you would include libraries
that implement any test framework you may use for your test programs but are not 
needed for the <a href="#PLIB">PLIB</a> library or a normal executable. For
example, given the defs.mk file: </p><code><PRE>
    PLIB = MyDataProc

    USESLIBS = MyMathRoutines

    MAINS = DeskTopDataProc.cc

    TESTEXES = TestDataProc.cc

    TESTLIBS = MyUnitTestFW
</PRE></code><p> The test program, TestDataProc, would be linked all three
libraries; MyDataProc, MyMathRoutines and MyUnitTestFW. The regular program,
DeskTopDataProc would not be linked with the MyUnitTestFW library.</p>

<p> NOTE: You can not use an entry of <code>TESTLIBS=Auto</code> to activate the
automatic inclusion of libraries as you can for PROGLIBS or USESLIBS. This
feature is unsupported for TESTLIBS; these libraries must be specified manually.
</p>

<P> Normally all libraries specified in TESTLIBS are required to exist to create
the executables. This is not always ideal, as some libraries may relate to
functionality that is not always required, or is not present on all systems.
With this type of library, we may want to include them if they are available,
but ignore them if the are not present. This can be achieved by adding 
<code>.opt</code> to the end of the library names, indicating they are optional.
For example an optional library would be added as: </p><code><pre>
    TESTLIBS = MyOptionalTestLib.opt
</pre></code>     
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="EXTERNALLIBS"></A><B>EXTERNALLIBS</B></DT>
<DD><p> It is often useful to use external libraries from a project's programs
or libraries. To do this QMake must be told where to look for the header files
from the external package and where the actual external library resides. This is
done with a library definition file or .def file.</p>

<p> When an external library is to be used, the user must first create the .def
file. This should be created in a suitable location in the project's directory
tree. If the project has some code for interfacing to the external library,
perhaps providing a wrapper library, it makes sense to create the .def file in
that directory of the project structure. The .def file may be created from
scratch, or from the pro-forma file provided as part of QMake (see the
QMake/Support/Skeleton.def file, usually installed under /usr/local/share).</p>

<p> Once created, the .def file needs to be made available to the QMake system.
This is achieved by adding an <code>EXTERNALLIBS</code> entry to the defs.mk
file for the directory where the .def file has been created. The variable should
be set to the name of the .def file created. </p>

<p> Having been made available to QMake (via the EXTERNALLIBS definition), the
external library may be used by adding its name to the appropriate
<a href="#USESLIBS">USESLIBS</a>, <a href="#PROGLIBS">PROGLIBS</a> or
<a href="#TESTLIBS">TESTLIBS</a> variables as for any other library from your
project.</p>

<p> Adding a library to EXTERNALLIBS automatically adds the specified library to
the current directory's USESLIBS, and will be treated as a normal dependency if
a normal <a href="#PLIB">PLIB</a> library is also being created. </p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="LIBDEPS"></A><B>LIBDEPS</B></DT> 

<DD><p> LIBDEPS is used to redefine the name of the <code>.def</code> file
associated with the directory.  It is needed where the source for a single
library spans several directories.  The <code>defs.mk</code> in each directory
must contain a <i>unique</i> LIBDEPS entry, of the form <code>sublib.def</code>.
In this case, you don't need to create the <code>.def</code> file itself - it is
created automatically. <b>N.B.</b> The <i>first</i> directory to be compiled
must contain all the necessary <a href="#USESLIBS">USESLIBS</a> entries for the
whole library.</p>

<p> There is also a deprecated usage, to explicitly create references to
external libraries. This has been replaced by
<a href="#EXTERNALLIBS">EXTERNALLIBS</a>, above. </p>
</DD>
</LI>
</UL>





<H3><A NAME="platform"></A>Platform Support</H3>

<P> The default behaviour of the make system is to support all packages on all
platforms. The packages should be written in such a way that they can survive
the arrival of new software and hardware architectures quite easily. Software
written for a specific platform, like an operating system or a hardware card,
usually dies with the platform which often happens within 2-3 years of writing.
</P>

<P> There is sometimes a necessity to maintain software for special hardware
such as a frame grabber, etc. For these exceptional circumstances, the following
variables are provided: </P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="SUPPORT_ONLY"></A><B>SUPPORT_ONLY</B></DT>
<DD><p>A list of architectures which are supported. If the contents of this
variable clashes with DONOT_SUPPORT, then the architecture will be supported. If
neither SUPPORT_ONLY or DONOT_SUPPORT is set, then all architectures are
supported. For example: </p><code><PRE>
    SUPPORT_ONLY = sol2 alpha
</PRE></code><p>means that the subtree of directories including the current one
will be processed only for the Solaris2 and Alpha architectures.</p>

<DD><p> A list of architectures which is not supported. For example:</p><code><pre>
    DONOT_SUPPORT = sgi
</PRE></code><p> means that the subtree of directories including the current one
will be processed for all architectures except Silicon Graphics.</p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="REQUIRES"></A><B>REQUIRES</B></DT>
<DD><p>A space-separated list of features required to compile the module. For
example:</p><code><pre>
    REQUIRES = libGTK
</PRE></code><p> means that this directory and its subdirectories can only be
compiled if resource libGTK is available. The typical use for the REQUIRES
directive is to prevent code being built into the project if that code depends
on an external library that might not always be available. With the above
example, the REQUIRES entry could prevent QMake attempting to build any code
that relied on the GTK libraries, if those libraries were not present on the
system. </p>

<p> When you place a REQUIRES entry in your defs.mk file, QMake will only
attempt to use that directory (and any directories below it) if the required
resource is regarded as being present on the system. A resource is regarded as
being present  if its name appears in the list contained in the RESOURCES 
configuration variable. This variable is defined in the Config.Project file and
is a space separated list of available resources. If you have code protected by
a REQUIRES, you need to ensure that the name of the resource is listed in the
RESOURCES entry (assuming that the resource is actually installed on the 
machine on which you are working), otherwise QMake will not compile that
particular subset of your project. </p>

<H3><A NAME="examples"></A>Example programs</H3>

<P> The following two variables can be used for a specification of executables
used for a demonstration how to use packages or for their run-time checking.
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="EXAMPLES"></A><B>EXAMPLES</B></DT>
<DD><p> Contains the names of source files demonstrating the use of the software
in the directory.  They are copied into the documentation area.  The example
sources must be compilable; to check compilation, include them temporarily in
the <a href="#MAINS">MAINS</a> list, e.g.: </p><kbd><pre>
    qm MAINS=example.cc
</pre></kbd>   
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="TESTEXES"></A><B>TESTEXES</B></DT>
<DD><p> The list of executables testing runtime consistency of the software.
They are compiled and run to test if they produce expected results.  The
executables should return 0 on success, non-zero on failure.  If the program
doesn't exit normally it will be treated as a failure.  Both stdout and stderr
of the program are stored in a log during testing to help trace bugs. Testing
is performed using the 'qm test'.</p>
</DD>
</UL>




<H3><A NAME="special"></A>Special Files</H3>

<P>
The directory can contain special files which should be extracted from the
database of source files. They can be examples of data input, etc. The size of
these file should be kept to a minimum. The following variables can be used for
a specification of these files:
</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="AUXFILES"></A><B>AUXFILES, AUXDIR</B></DT>
<DD><p> Use these for data files that need to end up somewhere where your
program will always find them.  All files listed in AUXFILES are installed in
<code>$PROJECT_OUT/$AUXDIR</code>.  If AUXDIR is not used, the files are
 installed in $PROJECT_OUT.  Thus: </p><code><PRE>
    AUXFILES = mask.png
    AUXDIR = share/myproject
</PRE></code><p> will install the file mask.png in the directory
<code>$PROJECT_OUT/share/data</code>.  Any necessary subdirectories are
automatically created.</p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="PREBUILDSTEP"></A><B>PREBUILDSTEP</B></DT>
<DD><p> Command to execute before compiling libraries or executables. This
should be in Bourne shell script. QMake macros like $(PROJECT_OUT) for the
output directory may be used.</p>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="POSTBUILDSTEP"></A><B>POSTBUILDSTEP</B></DT>
<DD><p> Command to execute after compiling libraries and executables. This
should be in Bourne shell script. QMake macros like $(PROJECT_OUT) for the
output directory may be used.</p>
</DD>

</UL>




<H3><A NAME="documentation"></A>Documentation</H3>

<P> QMake utilises the <a href=Ravl.Documentation.html>CxxDoc</a>
documentation system to allow the production of project documentation from
comments included in the project source code. The following configuration
variables allow for extra information to supplement the documentation embedded
in the source files' comments.</P>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="EHT"></A><B>EHT</B></DT>
<DD><P> List of Extra HyperText files for supplementing the documentation
produced from the embedded comments in your project source files. Files listed
in this variable are used as additional input files for the CxxDoc utility when
creating the project documentation. Please refer to the
<a href=Ravl.Documentation.Branches.html>extra documentation</a> section of the
guide to documenting your project.  </P>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="HTML"></A><B>HTML</B></DT>
<DD><P> Contains the names of stand-alone documentation files (which need not
actually be written in hypertext) that are installed into the <code>html</code>
documentation sub-directory. Unlike those files listed by the
<a href="#EHT">EHT</a> variable, these files are simply installed as is, without
any preprocessing. They are not linked from the main documentation tree nor are
they listed in the <a href=../../sitemap.html>table of contents</a></P>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="MAN1"></A><B>MAN1</B></DT>
<DD><P> Lists the source files of manual pages to be integrated with section 1
(executables and shell commands) of the system on-line reference manual.</P>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="MAN3"></A><B>MAN3</B></DT>
<DD><P> Lists the source files of manual pages to be integrated with section 3
(library calls) of the system on-line reference manual.</P>
</DD>

<LI><DT><A NAME="MAN5"></A><B>MAN5</B></DT>
<DD><P> Lists the source files of manual pages to be integrated with section 5
(file formats and conventions) of the system on-line reference manual.</P>
</DD>

<h3><a name="compopts">Compiler options</a></h3> <p>Any valid compiler options
can be passed to the compiler and linker using the following variables.</p>

<UL>
<LI><DT><A NAME="CFLAGS"></A><B>CFLAGS CCFLAGS</B></DT>
<DD><p> Allows the setting of flags that need to be passed to the C or C++
compiler.  Should be set in the defs.mk file using the '+=' operator, to avoid
cancelling other options, for example: </p><code><pre>
    CFLAGS += -g
</pre></code>
</DD></LI>

<LI><DT><A NAME="CCPPFLAGS"></A><B>CPPFLAGS CCPPFLAGS</B></DT>
<DD><p> Sets any flags that need to be passed to the C or C++ preprocessor. 
Should be set with the '+=' operator, to avoid cancelling other options; for
example, to pass in a flag MYFLAG that your code can test with a preprocessor
directive such as <code>#if</code> or <code>#ifdef</code>, you can
use: </p><code><pre>
    CCPPFLAGS += -DMYFLAG=3
</pre></code>
</DD></LI>

<LI><DT><A NAME="LDFLAGS"></A><B>LDFLAGS</B></DT>
<DD><p> Flags that need to be passed to the linker.  Should be used with the
'+=' operator, to avoid cancelling other options. </p>
</DD></LI>

<LI><DT><A NAME="ANSIFLAG"></A><B>ANSIFLAG</B></DT>
<DD><p> Putting <code>ANSIFLAG=</code> has the effect of turning off strict
ANSI compatibility. </p>

<p>Note that the default QMake behaviour is to set strict ANSI compatibility.
So if for example you want C99 compatibility, which conflicts with ANSI C, you
would have to do it like this:</p><code><pre>
    CFLAGS += -std=c99
    ANSIFLAG=
</pre></code>
