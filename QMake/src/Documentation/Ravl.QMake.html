    <p>QMake is a flexible compilation aid, based on the GNU "make" program.
    It was originally developed for building the RAVL (and its predecessors)
    library, but it can be used for compiling any software project, however
    big or small.</p>

    <h2>Running QMake</h2>

    <p>The basic command is <code>qm</code>, which is a script that calls the
    <code>make</code> utility using the QMake makefiles.</p>

    <p>Typing <code>qm</code> with no arguments will build code that contains
    basic checks such as array bound violations.  It will use (and optionally
    create) static libraries. </p>

    <p>There are <a href="../../../html/Help.txt">various other QMake
    command-line options</a> you can use, e.g.: </p>

      <ul>

      <li>The debug options (e.g. <code>qm debug</code>) will build in
      debugging information.</li>

      <li> The optimised versions (e.g. <code>qm opt</code>) produce optimised
      code with no checking.</li>

      <li> You can include (and create) shared rather than static product
      libraries in your executable (e.g. <code>qm shared</code>, <code>qm
      optshared</code>).</li>

      <li>You can list the command-line options at any time by typing <code>
      <a href="../../../html/Help.txt"> qm help</a></code>.  </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="defs.mk">The "defs.mk" file</h2>

    <p>QMake relies on a simple text file ("<code>defs.mk</code>") being
    present in <i>each</i> directory of the project.  Each
    <code>defs.mk</code> contains a set of variables that describe what must
    be compiled <i>from that directory</i>.</p> 

    <p>Information describing the many variables in the <code>defs.mk</code>
    file for controlling what is built is given under <a
    href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html">Description File Variables </a>.  But to begin
    with, all you probably need is one or two of these:</p>

    <ul>
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#MAINS">MAINS</a> A list of programs to compile.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#SOURCES">SOURCES</a> Other source files to compile.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#HEADERS">HEADERS</a> Header files for this source code that need to be shared.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#PLIB">PLIB</a> Name of library to be created from the entries in SOURCES.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#PROGLIBS">PROGLIBS</a> Additional libraries only needed for executables defined in MAINS.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#USESLIBS">USESLIBS</a> Libraries needed by the library defined by PLIB.
      <li> <a href="Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#NESTED">NESTED</a> Subdirectories to compile.
    </ul>
    <p>E.g. if all you wanted to compile was one file called "fred.cc"
    containing a main program, the defs.mk file would contain the single line:
    </p> <pre>MAINS = fred.cc</pre>

    <p>Any of these variables can also be overridden on the command line,
    e.g.:</p>

    <pre>qm "MAINS = fred.cc"</pre> 

    <p>However a <code>defs.mk</code> file, even if empty, <i>must</i> exist
    in the current directory.</p>


<h2> Advanced Configuration </h2>


<p> QMake is optionally configured using a project configuration file. This
configuration file, allows a project to alter the default settings for QMake.
For instance, the project may be set to be compiled with a more or less
aggressive code optimistation level; or to use a different (experimental)
version of an external library.</p>

<p> When run, QMake will look for the file <code>Config.Project</code> in the
root directory of your project's build tree. If this file is found, QMake will
use the file's contents to override the default configuration settings. The
environment variable <code>CONFIGFILE</code> may be used to direct QMake to use
an alternative as the configuration file.</p>

<p> To configure your project to use non-default options, start by copying the
pro-forma <code>Config.Default</code> to <code>Config.Project</code> in the root
of your build (<code>PROJECT_OUT</code>) directory. The Config.Default file can
be found in the QMake <code>Projects/Skeleton</code> directory (this is usually
file <code>/usr/local/share/QMake/Projects/Skeleton/Config.Default</code>,
depending on where QMake was installed). You may then modify your newly created
Config.Project file to tailor how QMake behaves for your project.</p>

<p> The first item that you should change in your new configuration file is to
ensure that the value of <code>PROJECT_OUT</code> is set correctly. This
defaults to $HOME/ProjectOut; if you require your project to be built in a different
location, change the setting appropriately. The remaining changes that can be
made allow QMake to operate differently to the default when compiling your
particular project.</p>

<p> For example, to use a different C compiler when compiling your project, set
the <code>CC</code> variable to the pathname of the compiler you wish QMake to
use. The full list of command substitution variables that are supported by QMake
can be seen by referring to the default settings that are listed in the
<code>Config.QMake</code> file. This file declares the system-wide default QMake
settings and, dependent on where QMake was installed, can usually be found in
the <code>/usr/local/etc/QMake</code> directory.</p>

<p> To build your project so QMake uses a non-standard version of an external
library instead of the default, you must add modified XX_CFLAGS and XX_LIBS
variables to your configuration file (where XX_ is the name of the external
library as recognised by QMake). If you are adding an external library that has
not previously been recognised by QMake, you will also need to add the name of
the library to the list of RESOURCES that are available to QMake (append the
library's name to the setting of the RESOURCES variable in the configureation
file).</p>



<h2>Build Tags</h2>

<p>
If you have several versions of a piece of source code, built to different project outs it is very easy to get 
them confused and build the a piece of code to the wrong place.   To avoid doing this you can use a feature of
QMake called "Build Tags".   This feature attaches a tags your project out, build alias and source tree and then 
checks the tags are consistent before making a directory.
</p>
To use this feature you must:

<ul>
<li> Set BUILD_TAG=(Some tag) in your build alias or shell environment. 
<li> Write a file in the root of your project out called 'buildTag' containing the name of the build
<li> Write a file in the root of the source tree called 'buildTag' containing the name of the build
</ul>
<p>
When you do a build QMake will first go up the source tree looking for the 'buildTag' file, it will use the 
contents of the first one it finds.  It will then check that the value in the file match (less any whitespace) the 
one in the environment variable BUILD_TAG.  It will also check that the buildTag in the project out matches the 
BUILD_TAG value. Only if these two tests pass will QMake execute the compile command.
</p>

<!-- <li>Xemacs users: there is an <a href="../html/Ravl-mode.html">Xemacs</a> enhancement to allow easy QMake compilation from within Xemac. -->

<h2> Advanced: Including the results of other project outs in your build </h2>

<p>
It is possible to use the includes and libraries of another project in your own. To do this create a file with a name of your choice with the extension 'qpr'. In this file add a line 'EXTERNAL_PROJECTS += (project out to be used)'. There may be more than project directory if required, the names should be seperated by spaces.  Then install this is either the make system's install directory or the libdeps directory of your current project out.  You can do this by adding this to a defs.mk in your project. 
</p>
<p> For example, testBuild.gpr would contain: </p>
<code>
EXTERNAL_PROJECTS += /tmp/Build
</code>
<p> And the following would be added to a defs.mk in your main source tree: </p>

<code>
AUXDIR = lib/RAVL/libdep
AUXFILES = anotherProject.qpr
</code>
<p> Note: You will have to run make twice to build code,  once to install the project file.
