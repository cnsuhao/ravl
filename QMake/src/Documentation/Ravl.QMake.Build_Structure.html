QMake builds binary's and documentation into your PROJECT_OUT directory. This
page describes its structure.  The structure is based on the linux standard file
system.
<p>
<table BORDER="1" CELLPADDING="4" CELLSPACING="0">
<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/bin</b>
    <td> Receives scripts and compiled programs. Compiled programs
         are implemented via a symbolic link to the most recently
         built binary for a particular program. If the last build
         was a <code>qm opt</code>, the binaries linked to in the
         bin directory will be the optimised versions. If the next
         build undertaken is a <code>qm check</code>, the links
         will be replaced with links to the the check binaries. The
         actual binary files will reside in the relevant sub-dir.
         (see below). This directory should appear on your PATH
         executable searchlist.
</tr>

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/bin/utils/$VAR{/shared{/single.X{.Y}}}/bin</b>
    <td> Receives compiled programs for the specific build type
         (VAR=opt, debug, check, etc. Optional shared directory
         level for programs linked against shared libraries. Futher
         optional directory level for binaries linked against
         particular single shared libraries - the .X .Y suffixes
         indicate the single libraries used to build the binary,
         appending the name of each single library that has been used).
</tr>

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/include/$PROJECT{/$PACKAGE}</b>
    <td> Receives the header files for the project (with an optional
         package level sub-directory).
</tr>

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/lib/$ARC/$VAR{/shared{/single}}/</b>
    <td> Receives compiled libraries for the relevant build type
         (VAR=opt, debug, check, etc. Optional extra shared sub-dir
         for programs linked against shared libraries and a further
         extra single directory level for single shared libraries
         (<a href=Ravl.QMake.Defs.html#SINGLESO>SINGLESO</a>)). Unlike
         executables, there is only ever one single directory for all
         of the single libraries.

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/lib/$ARC/obj</b>
    <td> Receives object files needed for building static binaries
</tr>

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/lib/libdep</b>
    <td> Library dependancy files

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/lib/libdep/$PLIB.def</b>
    <td> Library dependancy file for library PLIB

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/lib/pkgconf</b>
    <td> Receives any pkgconfig meta file for the project

    <td> Receives the project documentation produced by the
         <a href=Ravl.Documentation.html>CxxDoc Documentation System</a>
</tr>

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/share/QMake</b>
    <td> Receives a working copy of QMake with which to build Ravl
         if there is not currently a version of QMake installed on the
         system.

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/test/$VAR{/shared{/single.X{.Y}}}/bin</b>
    <td> Receives compiled test programs for the relevant build type
         (VAR=opt, debug, check, etc. Optional extra shared sub-dir
         for programs linked against shared libraries, optional further
         layer for tests linked against specific single libraries).

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/test/$VAR{/shared{/single.X{.Y}}}/log</b>
    <td> Receives the output log files from the relevant test programs.
         As usual, VAR=opt, debug, check, etc. the optional extra shared
         and single.X{.Y} sub-directories are for test programs linked
         against shared and single-shared libraries.
</tr>

<tr><td><b> $PROJECT_OUT/transient</b>
    <td> Receives transient files from the build process. These files
         may be deleted once the project has been fully built. However,
         removal of these files will incur extra work should a 
         subsequent build be required.
