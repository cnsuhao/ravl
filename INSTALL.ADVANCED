Advanced Installation Topics

Basic installation of RAVL is discussed in the INSTALL file. This file
details further concepts and command-line switches.

As discussed in INSTALL, the default installation directory may be changed
using the switch --prefix=<dir>.  E.g.:

        ./configure --prefix=$HOME

will cause a subsequent 'make install' to place RAVL under the user's home
directory. 

See "./configure --help" for full list of options to re-direct individual file
types.  For example, --libdir=<dir> will redirect where the RAVL library is
installed.

The configure program tailors the RAVL source to the environment present
on your machine. Running ./configure will generate a Config.Project file that
records how RAVL has been set up. This file drives how RAVL is built and 
what features are enabled.

Configure will attempt to locate all of the optional external libraries that
RAVL can employ, enabling the functionality for all those it finds. Those it
does not find are dropped and their functionality is not included in RAVL.

A --with-<lib> configure switch is provided to actively demand that library
'<lib>' be used. If this request is made but the library is not found,
configure will error out. The --with-<lib> switch may be set to 'N'; 'No';
etc. to disable any particular library from use. The switch --without-<lib>
has the same effect. For example:

        ./configure --with-OpenCV=N --with-libPNG

is equivalent to

        ./configure --without-OpenCV --with-libPNG=Y

and explicitly disables the use of OpenCV by RAVL (even if OpenCV is installed
on the machine) while requiring libPNG.

The configure program uses the pkg-config utility to locate the third-party
libraries that RAVL can use. If the pkg-config meta file for a third-party
library is not available in its usual location, configure provides an option
to tell the configuration process where the file resides:

   --with-<lib>-pkgconf=<path-to>/<meta-file>

For external libraries that support pkg-config, this switch allows the user to
specify the location and name of a pkg-config file for a particular library,
<lib>. For example:

           ./configure --with-OpenCV-pkgconf=/opt/lib/pkg-config/opencv.pc

instructs the configuration process to use the specified file,
/opt/lib/pkg-config/opencv.pc, as the pkg-config meta file. This enables the
user to instruct RAVL to be built using a particular version of a third-party
library.

Some of the third-party libraries (LibJasper, LibTIFF, Zlib, JPEG and
posixThreads) that may be used by RAVL do not support the pkg-config utility.
To allow configuration with these, configure provides the command-line
options:

   --with-<lib>-include=<path-to-include-files>

For libraries that do not normally use pkg-config (and those alone), this
switch provides a mechanism for declaring where the library's header file(s)
can be found.

   --with-<lib>-library=<path-to>/<library-name>

As for --with-<lib>-include, this is only provided for those libraries that do
not normally support pkg-config. It allows declaration of both where the third
party library may be found and also allows its name to be specified. When
specifying the name of the library, do not include any format extension (the
.a or .so suffix).

These two switches are typically used in tandem to override the defaults
associated with a particular library. For example:

           ./configure --with-JPEG-include=/opt/libjpeg-turbo/include \
                       --with-JPEG-library=/opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib/libjpeg

will employ libjpeg-turbo instead of the more usual JPEG library. As the
libjpeg-turbo library is a direct, drop-in replacement for the JPEG library,
use of these switches allows RAVL to use libjpeg-turbo's more optimal code on
machines where it is installed.

Setting any of these --with-<lib>-xxx switches implies --with-<lib> and thus
mandates that configure find and enable the library or error out. 

The RAVL build process uses the default compiler available in your system
path. Should you wish to change this, prior to running configure, set the
environment variables CC and/or CXX to the location(s) of the C and C++
compilers you wish to use. Other influential environment variables allow
for the redefinition of other commands for the build process to use or to
allow the specification of extra CFLAGS to use.

A full list of configure's available command-line switches and significant
environment variables may be seen by issuing the command:

        ./configure --help=recursive

By executing configure in a directory away from where you installed the RAVL
source, it is possible to separate out the build and source locations. For
instance, the commands:

        mkdir ~/Source
        cd ~/Source
        tar -xvf $ArchivePath
        mkdir /tmp/Build
        cd /tmp/Build
        ~/Source/configure
        make
        make install

will install the RAVL source in the Source directory under the user's home
location. RAVL itself will be built in the /tmp/Build directory which could
be later deleted to save space once RAVL has been installed.
